/**
 * @defgroup APP_ONOFF Generic OnOff server behaviour
 * @ingroup MESH_API_GROUP_APP_SUPPORT
 * Application level OnOff server behavioral structures, functions, and callbacks.
 *
 * This module implements the behavioral requirements of the Generic OnOff server model.
 *
 * The application should use the set callback provided by this module to set the hardware state.
 * The hardware state could be changed by reflecting the value provided by the set callback on the GPIO
 * or by sending this value to the connected lighting peripheral using some other interface (e.g.
 * serial interface). Similarly, the application should use the get callback provided by this
 * module to read the hardware state.
 *
 * This module triggers the set callback only when it determins that it is time to inform the user
 * application. It is possible that the client can send multiple overlapping set commands.
 * In such case any transition in progress will be abandoned and fresh transition will be started if
 * required.
 * <br>
 * @warning To comply with the Mesh Model Specification test cases, the application must adhere to the
 * requirements defined in the following sections:
 * - Section 3.1.1 (Generic OnOff) and Section 3.3.1.2 (Generic OnOff state behaviour) of Mesh
 * Model Specification v1.0.
 * - Section 3.7.6.1 (Publish) of Mesh Profile Specification v1.0.
 *
 * These requirements are documented at appropriate places in the module source code.
